The document effectively uses quantifiable achievements and metrics throughout, showcasing impact across various roles. The skills section comprehensively covers relevant technical abilities, and the formatting is generally clean and scannable. Areas for improvement include adding a professional summary, slightly reducing text density, incorporating more collaborative achievements, and providing more details on problem-solving methodologies. The resume effectively balances technical competencies with leadership experiences but could benefit from more explicit connections between extracurricular activities and transferable workplace skills. Overall, the resume presents a compelling picture of a technically skilled candidate with leadership potential.\n  </score_justification>\n\n  <final_score>87</final_score>\n</resume_analysis>"
